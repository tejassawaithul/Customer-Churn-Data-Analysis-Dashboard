✨ Excited to share my latest Power BI project – Customer Churn Data Analysis Dashboard! 🚀

With this interactive dashboard, I analyzed customer churn patterns to uncover key trends and insights that can help businesses enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn effectively.

📊 Key Highlights:

✅ Total Customers, Churn Rate, and New Joiners to track overall performance 📈

 ✅ Churn Breakdown by Age, Tenure, and Contract Type to identify high-risk segments 🎯

 ✅ State-wise Churn Rate to pinpoint regions with the highest customer attrition 🗺️

 ✅ Impact of Services & Payment Methods on churn behavior 💳

 ✅ Churn by Internet Type & Service Usage to assess how different offerings influence customer retention 🌐

This analysis helps businesses understand customer attrition, identify high-risk segments, and develop strategies to improve retention. With Power BI, I transformed complex data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions for better customer experience and business growth.
